From July 1st you can use CoronaCheck for <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-vaccinatie/vraag-en-antwoord/wat-is-het-eu-digitaal-corona-certificaat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travels within the European Union</a>.

Creating a certificate of recovery using CoronaCheck will be possible from version 2.1 of the CoronaCheck app. This version of the app will become available in the app stores in the course of the day. A certificate of recovery can only be created if your positive test was carried out by the GGD. 

Are you having trouble retrieving your vaccination details? Vaccination details are retrieved from the systems of the RIVM, the GGD and connected general practitioners. This may take a few days.

If you have been vaccinated longer ago and cannot retrieve your details or if they are not correct, please contact your vaccinator (GGD, hospital, general practitioner or another healthcare provider).
